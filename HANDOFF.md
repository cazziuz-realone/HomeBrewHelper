- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Repository Pattern
- **Minimum SDK**: 24 (Android 7.0)
- **Target SDK**: 36
- **Gradle**: Kotlin DSL

### Dependencies (Current)
```kotlin
// Core Android
implementation(libs.androidx.core.ktx)
implementation(libs.androidx.lifecycle.runtime.ktx)
implementation(libs.androidx.activity.compose)

// Jetpack Compose
implementation(platform(libs.androidx.compose.bom))
implementation(libs.androidx.ui)
implementation(libs.androidx.ui.graphics)
implementation(libs.androidx.ui.tooling.preview)
implementation(libs.androidx.material3)
```

### Dependencies (Planned for Phase 1)
- Room Database for local persistence
- Navigation Compose for app navigation
- ViewModel and LiveData for state management
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Gson/Kotlinx Serialization for data handling

## Development Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps (Next 15 minutes)
1. **CURRENT TASK**: Update build.gradle.kts with Phase 1 dependencies
2. Create basic data models for Recipe Management
3. Set up Room database schema
4. Create Recipe Builder UI components

### Today's Goals
1. Complete Recipe Management System foundation
2. Basic Recipe data models and database setup
3. Simple Recipe Builder UI with form inputs
4. Basic navigation structure

### This Week's Goals  
1. Functional Recipe Builder with ingredient database
2. Recipe Library with basic CRUD operations
3. Recipe scaling calculations
4. Basic batch tracking setup

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Database Choice: Room
- **Rationale**: Native Android ORM, excellent Compose integration, offline-first approach
- **Alternative Considered**: SQLite directly (rejected for complexity)

### Architecture: MVVM + Repository
- **Rationale**: Standard Android pattern, excellent testability, clean separation
- **Repository Layer**: Abstracts data sources for future remote sync capability

### UI Framework: Pure Jetpack Compose
- **Rationale**: Modern Android UI, excellent state management, future-proof
- **No XML**: Full Compose approach for consistency

## Known Technical Challenges

### Ingredient Database Complexity
- **Challenge**: Supporting 5+ beverage types with unique ingredients
- **Approach**: Flexible database schema with beverage-specific fields
- **Risk**: Performance with large ingredient datasets

### Recipe Scaling Mathematics
- **Challenge**: Complex calculations for different ingredient types
- **Approach**: Dedicated calculation engine with unit testing
- **Risk**: Precision errors in professional brewing contexts

### Multi-Beverage Support
- **Challenge**: Shared UI components vs beverage-specific features
- **Approach**: Base classes with beverage-specific extensions
- **Risk**: UI complexity and maintenance overhead

## Code Quality Standards

### Kotlin Best Practices
- Immutable data classes where possible
- Sealed classes for state management
- Extension functions for reusable logic
- Null safety throughout

### Jetpack Compose Standards
- Stateless composables where possible
- State hoisting pattern
- Preview functions for all components
- Consistent naming conventions

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for ViewModels and business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Repository pattern enables easy mocking

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Android Studio Ladybug or later
- Kotlin 1.9+
- Java 11+
- Android SDK 36

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone repository
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle dependencies
4. Run on API 24+ device/emulator

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Database Schema Evolution**: Complex migrations as features expand
2. **Performance**: Large datasets in mobile environment
3. **User Experience**: Complexity of multi-beverage support

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Careful database versioning and migration planning
2. Pagination and lazy loading patterns
3. Progressive disclosure and intuitive navigation

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Create and save a complete beer recipe
- [ ] Create and save a complete wine recipe  
- [ ] Scale recipe to different batch sizes
- [ ] Navigate between major app sections
- [ ] Persist data across app restarts

### Technical Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero memory leaks in core flows
- [ ] < 2 second app startup time
- [ ] Smooth scrolling in recipe lists
- [ ] Successful builds on CI/CD

## Notes and Observations

### Development Approach
- Focus on working functionality over polish in Phase 1
- Establish solid architectural foundation for future features
- Mobile-first design but consider tablet layouts
- Offline-first approach with future sync capability

### User Experience Priorities
1. Recipe creation must be intuitive for beginners
2. Advanced features available but not overwhelming
3. Clear visual distinction between beverage types
4. Quick access to frequently used functions
